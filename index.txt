                    <p class="p-text">Recent advancements in the use of machine learning for identifying dyscalculia have yielded promising outcomes. 
                        Prior studies have explored various algorithms including Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Regression Models for early prediction, 
                        particularly in young learners[1]. However, these systems often overlook adaptive questioning tailored to individual learning levels, 
                        which is essential for sustained engagement and assessment accuracy. 
                        Giggle addresses this by dynamically adjusting question complexity based on each childâ€™s progress and performance. </p>
                    <br>

                    <div class="wow fadeInUpBig" data-wow-duration="1.3s" data-wow-delay="0.4s">
                        <p class="p-text">Research further emphasizes the importance of monitoring attention and emotional states to better understand learning 
                        barriers. Although tools like Lumosity and CogniFit improve general cognition, they lack the capacity to detect real-time engagement 
                        levels or emotional responses. Some systems, such as those using CNN or VR platforms, offer immersive experiences but still fall 
                        short in tracking behavioral responses[2]. 
                        Giggle incorporates emotion and concentration monitoring to ensure students receive timely and supportive intervention during learning. </p>
                    </div>
                    <br>

                    <div class="wow fadeInUpBig" data-wow-duration="1.3s" data-wow-delay="0.5s">
                        <p class="p-text">Another gap in existing literature is the insufficient support for teaching mathematical procedures step-by-step. 
                        Tools such as "KidKanit"[3] and "Ganitha Piyasa" [4] provide visual aids and handwriting support, yet they do not systematically 
                        reinforce procedural math or gesture tracking. 
                        Giggle bridges this gap by allowing students to write each step, track their sequence accuracy, and reinforce rules and patterns critical for long-term retention. </p>
                    </div>
                    <br>

                    <div class="wow fadeInUpBig" data-wow-duration="1.3s" data-wow-delay="0.6s">
                        <p class="p-text">Lastly, many studies explore verbal interactions through NLP and speech recognition, but most lack structure in how 
                        verbal math tasks are practiced or assessed[5]. Existing apps may allow basic voice inputs or chatbot communication but do not provide 
                        real-time feedback on pronunciation accuracy or progress. 
                        Giggle strengthens this component by evaluating verbal responses, identifying pronunciation difficulties, and offering corrective feedback to improve oral math proficiency.  </p>
